      "description": "<p>The geology of Smith Rocks is volcanic. It is made up of layers of recent&nbsp;basalt&nbsp;flows overlaying older Clarno&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Volcanic_ash\">a<\/a>s<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Volcanic_ash\">h<\/a>&nbsp;and tuff formations. Approximately 30&nbsp;million years ago, a large&nbsp;caldera&nbsp;was formed (Crooked River caldera) when overlying rock collapsed into an underground&nbsp;lava&nbsp;chamber. This created a huge amount of rock and ash debris that filled the caldera. That material solidified into rock, becoming Smith Rock&nbsp;tuff. Rhyolite flows intruded along faults in the Smith Rock Tuff.&nbsp;A half million years ago, basalt lava flows from nearby volcanoes covered the older tuff.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently, the&nbsp;Crooked<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crooked_River_(Oregon)\"> River<\/a>&nbsp;cut its way through the layers of rock to create today&#39;s geographic features. Smith Rock itself is a 3,200-foot (980&nbsp;m)-high ridge (above sea level) with a sheer cliff-face overlooking a bend in the Crooked River (elev. 2600&nbsp;ft), making the cliffs about 600 feet high.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Where else can you walk behind a waterfall? Check out the famous South Falls and see what a 177-foot curtain of water looks like from behind. It&rsquo;s part of the Trail of Ten Falls, a spectacular, nationally recognized hiking trail that weaves through a dense forested landscape. The trail passes a series of breathtaking waterfalls along a rocky canyon, and descends to a winding creek at the forest floor. This 7.2 mile loop is considered to be a moderate hike, with an overall elevation change of 800 feet.&nbsp; Several connecting trails with separate access points make shorter routes. For everyone&rsquo;s safety&mdash; absolutely no pets allowed on the Canyon Trail.&nbsp; Pets on leash are allowed on all other trails.<\/p>",
